# Team Profile Generator - Dynamically Generating HTML with Node.js 

## Description
This is a Node.js command-line application that generates an HTML webpage displaying information about a software engineering team. The application takes in input from the user and displays information about the team, including the names of team members, their roles, and other key information. To achieve this, the application uses the Inquirer package to collect input from the user, and Jest to run unit tests.

This project was a lot of fun, but I struggled a lot with initally setting up my prompts. However, within time I was able to figure things out and now this appplication is complete! I would like to visit the code once again in the future to adjust the mailTo method being used since as of now it only opens the mail server but does not enter the TO field with the corresponding email address.
